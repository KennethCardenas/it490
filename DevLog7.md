## Date / Module: July 13, 2025 / Module 7
## Name: Kenneth Cardenas

### GitHub Issue Links Assigned
- [x] Deployment System Core Architecture
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Scripts for code promotion between environments
    - Backup/restore functionality
    - Minimal user interaction design
    - Non-Git based solution
  - Started Date: July 9, 2025
  - Target Completion Date: July 13, 2025
  - Finished Date: July 14, 2025
  - Summary of individual contribution:
    - Designed core rsync-based deployment logic
    - Implemented environment verification checks
    - Created rollback mechanism

- [x] QA Environment Setup
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Fresh VMs for QA environment
    - Automated provisioning scripts
    - Configuration parity with Dev
  - Started Date: July 11, 2025
  - Target Completion Date: July 12, 2025
  - Finished Date: July 12, 2025
  - Summary of individual contribution:
    - Configured qa-app and qa-api VMs
    - Validated service connectivity
    - Documented environment differences

### Noteworthy Learnings and resource links
- Rsync advanced options: https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync
- Bash trap signals for cleanup: https://linuxhint.com/bash_trap_command/
- Learned importance of checksum verification in deployments
- Discovered value of atomic operations for rollback safety
- SSH config management for multi-environment access

### Problems/Difficulties Encountered
- Permission propagation issues during file transfers
- Service dependency resolution during promotions
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Atomic rollback implementation challenges
- SSH key management across multiple VMs

### Positive Shoutout to Team Member(s)
- **Filip**: Developed the core promotion engine using rsync with checksum validation
- **Jonathan**: Created the backup snapshot system with timestamped rollback points
- **Chris**: Implemented the configuration transformer for environment-specific adjustments
- **Antonio**: Designed the verification suite that validates successful deployments
- **Jerry**: Built the user interface wrapper that reduces manual input errors

### What can be improved individually?
- More comprehensive pre-deployment validation
- Better documentation of edge cases
- Earlier testing of rollback scenarios
- More frequent intermediate backups

### What can be improved as a team?
- Standardized environment variables earlier
- Shared deployment checklist
- Better division of verification tasks
- More thorough dry-run testing
